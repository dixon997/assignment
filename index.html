	<h2><strong>History of Coney Island:</strong></h2>

	<p class="content">Coney Island, also known as Pulau Serangoon, is located at the coast of Punggol in the northeastern region of Singapore. 	In 1950, it was sold to a businessman who developed it into a resort. This however, only lasted for 3 years. In 1975 the government acquired 	ownership to the island and began land reclamation to expand the island. On 10 October 2015, Coney Island Park was officially opened to the 	public.
